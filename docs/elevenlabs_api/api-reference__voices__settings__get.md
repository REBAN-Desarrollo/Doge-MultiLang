            Determines how stable the voice is and the randomness between each
            generation. Lower values introduce broader emotional range for the
            voice. Higher values can result in a monotonous voice with limited
            emotion.

          type: boolean
          description: >-
            This setting boosts the similarity to the original speaker. Using
            this setting requires a slightly higher computational load, which in
            turn increases latency.
        similarity_boost:
          type: number
          format: double
          description: >-
            Determines how closely the AI should adhere to the original voice
            when attempting to replicate it.
        style:
          type: number
          format: double
          description: >-
            Determines the style exaggeration of the voice. This setting
            attempts to amplify the style of the original speaker. It does
            consume additional computational resources and might increase
            latency if set to anything other than 0.
        speed:
          type: number
          format: double
          description: >-
            Adjusts the speed of the voice. A value of 1.0 is the default speed,
            while values less than 1.0 slow down the speech, and values greater
            than 1.0 speed it up.
